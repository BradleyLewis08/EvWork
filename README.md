#Evwork

Evwork is a mobile app that lets Electric Vehicle owners rent out their unused chargers for other EV drivers, massively expanding the network of charging spots while providing people with passive income. Just like Airbnb allowed homeowners to sell unused space and provide better consumer experiences, we aim to leverage unused chargers to incentivize EV adoption and reduce the worry of “running out of battery.” As an EV owner, you connect your car with our mobile app. Then, whenever you’re in need of a quick charge, you can search for a convenient location, and we minimize cost and distance to match you with the best charging hub in our network. As an owner, you can also add your charger into our network through the app, which provides you with full control over when you want to rent it out. We’ll do the heavy lifting identifying cars while you make passive income and help reduce carbon emissions.
